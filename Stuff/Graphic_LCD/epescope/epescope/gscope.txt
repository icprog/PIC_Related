PIC Graphics LCD Scope by John Becker
-------------------------------------

Everyday Practical Electronics / ETI / EPE Online May 2001

Long awaited, this is a PIC controlled graphics LCD signal monitor
for your workshop. A self contained single channel unit catering
nominally for the audio range. Displays the waveform, p-p voltage
and frequency on a 64 x 128 graphics LCD.

Simple design, battery powered, easy to build on a single PCB.

The latest version of the software is available from the EPE Online Library at www.epemag.com

Please refer to the EPE web site for details of ordering back issues, subscriptions etc.
