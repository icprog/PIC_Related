 *
 * A Terminal is an abstract representation of a unix-like terminal. It holds a 
 * data string. Whenever the data is updated, a callback is called, to allow di-
 * rect updates on a display or elsewhere. 
 * Data may be added and removed at the end of the string, nowhere else.
 * 
 * The namespace_struct eases function names. Functions may now be called any-
 * where with, for example:
 * 
 *     terminal.construct(...);
