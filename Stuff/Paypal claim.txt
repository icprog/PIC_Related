This was a purchase on EBay, which Ebay later removed the Item , saying that someone hacked the sellers account, and the item was not available, & that I should ask for a refund. If I go to EBay resolution center, they say they can't initiate a refund, because there is a problem with the payment, go to Paypal for resolution.
I come to Paypal, & Paypal says go to the Seller, or to EBay resolution Center. The seller does not answer to my query, and the Ebay resolution center says to come to Paypal.
I see on my activity page, it says this payment is still pending, which is probably why EBay can't do anything. (And, maybe why the seller is not doing anything either, maybe he didn't actually get paid?)
While the Paypal status shows pending, my bank shows me that the money definately went out of my bank account. How do I get it back?
