At current processor speed & current code level, runs through 208 cycles/second Nov 30/2017
(Use this info for timing purposes)

Will control pump to control flow (PI), with programable flow curves            
Set Up with Timer 1 as Sync source, 4Hz PWM, 8 bits of resolution               May 12/2017         May 13/2017
Still need to setup Programmable Pump Outputs                                                       Nov 30/2017

Set Up Timer 2 as Brew Timer, accurate to 1/100th second                        May 13/2017         May 13/2107

Boiler Temp (PID), with On/Off if more than set degrees(dead-band) away from 
Setpoint (Removed On/Off, can do with Derivative Tuning)

Tank Water level Indication using 0-10" Pressure sensor and 5V air pump to
 measure level                                                                  ?? Done

Grouphead Temperature control, using PID and PTC heaters (On/Off control until 
close to Setpoint) (Also, removed On/Off control)                                                              ?? Done

Graphical Nokia 5110 LCD                                                        April 2017          ?? Apr/17

This is copied from another project, much will change over time,                Oct 09/2017
 it currently compiles and loads, but does pretty much nothing.

Still need to add ESC Key to user settings menus

Need to add EEPROM storage for user selectable coffee profiles (Temp setpoints, pre-infusion time, soak time, etc...)
