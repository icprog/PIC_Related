ABOUT THIS DEMO
This project demonstrates how to use the Noritake_VFD_CUU code
library to set the brightness on Noritake CU-U Vacuum
Fluorescent Display (VFD) modules. You MUST download and install
the Noritake_VFD_CUU code library before running the demo.

	http://www.noritake-elec.com

Please refer to the instructions on the download page and
"README" included with the Noritake_VFD_CUU code library for
information on how to install the Noritake_VFD_CUU code library 
and demos.  This document assumes that you have already
configured "config.h" file in the Noritake_VFD_CUU code library
as described in those documents.

For more information on the methods used in this document, please
refer to the method reference documentation in the
Noritake_VFD_CUU code library.

----------------------------------------------------------------
BEHAVIOR
This demo will behave differently depending on which Noritake
CU-U VFD module you will use. Set NORITAKE_VFD_BRIGHTNESS_BOOST
to 1 if your VFD module has the brightness boost feature. Set
NORITAKE_VFD_BRIGHTNESS_BOOST to 0 if your VFD module does not 
have the brightness boost feature.

The Noritake VFD CU-U modules that support brightness boost will
have model numbers in the following form:

	CU*****-UX**

	Example: CU20025-UX1J

For modules WITHOUT the brightness boost feature:
	1) This demo will set the brightness to 25% and display:
		Noritake
		25% Brightness
	2) Wait 1 second.
	3) Set the brightness to 50% and display:
		Noritake
		50% Brightness
	4) Wait 1 second.
	5) Set the brightness to 75% and display:
		Noritake
		75% Brightness
	6) Wait 1 second.
	7) Set the brightness to 100% and display:
		Noritake
		100% Brightness
	8) Wait 1 second.
	9) Repeat from step 1.

For modules with the brightness boost feature:
	1) This demo will set the brightness to 50% and display:
		Noritake
		50% Brightness
	2) Wait 1 second.
	3) Set the brightness to 100% and display:
		Noritake
		100% Brightness
	4) Wait 1 second.
	5) Set the brightness to 150% and display:
		Noritake
		150% Brightness
	6) Wait 1 second.
	7) Set the brightness to 200% and display:
		Noritake
		200% Brightness
	8) Wait 1 second.
	9) Repeat from step 1.

----------------------------------------------------------------
KEY POINTS
1) Initialize the VFD module with the CUU_init() method.
2) Print with print() method.
3) Set the brightness with CUU_brightness() method.
4) Move the cursor with CUU_setCursor() method.

LISTING
#include "../src/config.h"
#include "../src/Noritake_VFD_CUU.h"
#include <util/delay.h>

int main() {
	Noritake_VFD_CUU vfd;

#if NORITAKE_VFD_BRIGHTNESS_BOOST==1
	int min = 50, max = 200, step = 50;
#else
	int min = 25, max = 100, step = 25;
#endif

	vfd.CUU_init(); // initialize VFD
	vfd.print("Noritake"); // print Noritake on the first line
	for (;;)
		for (int i = min; i<=max; i+=step) {
			vfd.CUU_brightness(i); // Set the brightness
			vfd.CUU_setCursor(0,1); // Go to second line
			vfd.print(i); // print the brightness value
			vfd.print("% Brightness ");
			_delay_ms(1000); // wait one second
		}
}
