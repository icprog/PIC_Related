ABOUT THIS DOCUMENT

The Noritake_VFD_CUU code library can work in a variety of
hardware settings. You must set the configuration options in
config.h to match your host system's hardware, VFD module
parameters, and the interface between the host and VFD module.

When compiling the code library, you may compile all of the source
files even if you do not intend to use that interface.
Source files for interfaces that are not selected will
disable themselves based on the settings in config.h. To set
the configuration options, define a preprocessor varible
with that name to one of the values indicated in the
descriptions below. A default config.h is included in the
code library download. You may modify this to change the
configuration options.

You can find information and purchasing options for Noritake
VFDs at http://noritake-elec.com/uversion.htm

There are a few mandatory options you must set regardless of
which interface you are using.

	F_CPU
	  CPU frequency in Hertz

	NORITAKE_VFD_RESET_DELAY
	  Delay time between the Atmel starting and the CU-U
	  VFD module being initialized. This is necessary to
	  allow the module's controller to initialize.
	  
	  This value will vary depend on the power supply and
	  hardware setup.
	  
	  500 ms is more than enough time for the module to
	  start up.

	NORITAKE_VFD_COLS
	  The number of columns on the display

	NORITAKE_VFD_LINES
	  The number of lines on the display

	NORITAKE_VFD_BRIGHTNESS_BOOST
	  1: Using a CU-UX module that supports brightness boost:
		CU*****-UX**

		Example: CU20025-UX1J
	  0: Does not support brightness boost

	NORITAKE_VFD_CU20045_UW4J
	  1: Using a CU20045-UW4J (different addresses
		from other CU-U 20x4 models)
	  0: Using any other model
  
    NORITAKE_VFD_BC
      0: CU-U VFD Module
      1: DS2045G VFD
    
    NORITAKE_VFD_FONT
      1: 0x80-0xFF are Japanese Katakana (default)
      0: 0x80-0xFF are European characters

To select the serial interface, you must set NORITAKE_VFD_INTERFACE to 0.
Please refer to the manual for your module on how to set the jumpers
to use the serial interface.

	NORITAKE_VFD_INTERFACE	0
	SIO_PORT & SIO_PIN	port & pin# of the SIO/DAT line
	SCK_PORT & SCK_PIN	port & pin# of the clock line
	STB_PORT & STB_PIN	port & pin# of the strobe line

To select a parallel interface, you must set NORITAKE_VFD_INTERFACE to 1.
For all parallel modes, you must define:

	NORITAKE_VFD_4BIT
		If this value is 1, then only the four pins D4-D7
		are used for data. If the value is 0, then all eight
		pins are used for data.
	
	Data port & pin numbers:
		D4_PORT & D4_PIN
		D5_PORT & D5_PIN
		D6_PORT & D6_PIN
		D7_PORT & D7_PIN

	These need to be defined only if NORITAKE_VFD_4BIT is 0:
		D0_PORT & D0_PIN
		D1_PORT & D1_PIN
		D2_PORT & D2_PIN
		D3_PORT & D3_PIN

To select the parallel M68 interface, you must set
NORITAKE_VFD_INTERFACE to 1 and NORITAKE_VFD_PARALLEL to 0. Please
refer to the spec for your module on how to set the jumpers to
use the M68 parallel interface. To configure the code library, you
must define:

	NORITAKE_VFD_INTERFACE	0
	NORITAKE_VFD_PARALLEL	0

	NORITAKE_VFD_NO_RW_LINE
		Define to 1 if the R/W in M68 line is not used.
		Any read will immediately return 0. If you have the
		R/W line connected, set this value to 1.
		This has no effect on I80 or serial interface.

	RS_PORT & RS_PIN	port & pin# of RS line
	RW_PORT & RW_PIN	port & pin# of R/W line
	E_PORT & E_PIN		port & pin# of E line
		
To select the I80 parallel interface, you must set
NORITAKE_VFD_INTERFACE to 1 and NORITAKE_VFD_PARALLEL to 1. Please
refer to the spec for your module on how to set the jumpers to
use the parallel I80 interface. To configure the code library, you
must define:

	NORITAKE_VFD_INTERFACE	0
	NORITAKE_VFD_PARALLEL	1

	RS_PORT & RS_PIN	port & pin# of RS line
	WR_PORT & WR_PIN	port & pin# of WR line
	RD_PORT & RD_PIN	port & pin# of RD line

The data lines (bits 0-7) for the parallel interfaces. If 4-bit
mode is enabled with NORITAKE_VFD_4BIT as 1, then only D4-D7 need
be defined.

----------------------------------------------------------------
F_CPU
Processor speed in hertz.
	Example:
	16000000UL for 16MHz

----------------------------------------------------------------
NORITAKE_VFD_4BIT
If this is set to 1, then the parallel connection is setup to use
only four data pins (D4-D7). This option is for parallel
interfaces only.

----------------------------------------------------------------
NORITAKE_VFD_BRIGHTNESS_BOOST
Having this macro set to 1 allows you to correctly use CU-UX
