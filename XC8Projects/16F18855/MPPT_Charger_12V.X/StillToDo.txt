Setup Pin Manager                                                               
Set up lead_acid.h (maybe add a agm.h)                                          Added lead_acid_agm.h
Check direction of PWM Outputs                                                  It is backwards, Increases to dutyCycle cause decrease to Output Voltage
Battery Charging State machine needs finishing
Button menu interface
Splash screen?
Battery Fault needs to do something
Fix switch inputs on Board & Schematic                                          Need re-work & new boards, for now, cut trace in 2 places, solder resistor across, & add jumper to R38 to R39
power Buffers with higher voltage than rest of board                            Need re-work & new boards
Add caps on output of PWM Pins
Use different current sensor ideology (these suck!!)                            Need re-work & new boards,        
move programming header                                                         Need re-work & new boards,
Label Switches                                                                  Need re-work & new boards,
Add cooling fan control                                                         Use a Temperature input, as PWM Output, drive N Channel FET
Timer4 Not needed, just used to test different update frequencies
